                      <h1 class="display-4" style="font-size: 24px">Welcome to my website! I am thrilled to share with you a glimpse into my life and passions.
                        As an outdoor enthusiast, I love to spend my free time engaging in activities such as snowboarding and hiking.
                         I also have a deep curiosity for learning and enjoy exploring new and random subjects. In my spare time, you might find me playing chess, exercising, or designing software development projects.
                        My fascination with computers began at a young age. I was only 8 years old when I discovered the captivating technology culture of YouTube. 
                        Since then, I have been driven by a desire to experiment with computers and all that they have to offer. I even attempted to use an old Xbox as a case for a computer build during a school project in 8th grade, 
                        despite it being a failure, my passion remained unwavering.
                         As a result of my unwavering passion, I chose computer science as my college major. I am grateful for this decision because it has allowed me to study the topics I love and pursue my passion for software development.
                        Thank you for visiting my website and learning a little more about me!
